1. Survey Question Collection and Validation:

Description: The application validates the responses, and ensures all questions are answered. It utilizes variables and variable scope to store and check the survey responses. It employs loops and conditional control structures to prompt the customer for each question and verify if all questions have been answered. Error handling is used to handle any potential issues or invalid responses.

2. Voucher Generation and Distribution:

Description: After the customer completes the survey successfully, the application generates the $20 voucher. It utilizes variables and variable scope to generate. Conditional control structures are used to check if the survey responses are valid before generating the voucher. Error handling is implemented to handle any potential errors during the voucher generation process.

3. User Interface and Error Messaging:

Description: The application provides a usable interface by displaying the survey questions and receiving input from the customer. It uses print statements to present the questions and input functions to gather the customer's responses. Error handling is implemented to handle incorrect inputs or incomplete surveys. If a survey is incomplete or invalid, the application provides appropriate error messages to guide the customer and prompt them to complete the survey correctly.

Note: I did not stick to a implmentation plan for this assignment. This is just a hypothetical draft for what it would have looked like if it did and is a learning curve for doing it in the future

Implementation Plan:

Feature 1: Survey Question Collection and Validation
Deadline: Week 1

Task 1: Define the Customer class with necessary attributes and methods
Task 2: Implement the collect_survey_response() method in the Customer class to store survey responses
Task 3: Implement the validate_responses() method in the Customer class to check if all questions are answered
Task 4: Implement the display_survey_questions() method in the Restaurant class to show survey questions
Task 5: Implement the collect_survey_responses() method in the Restaurant class to collect responses from the customer

Feature 2: Voucher Generation and Distribution
Deadline: Week 2

Task 1: Enhance the Customer class with the generate_voucher() method to generate the $20 voucher
Task 2: Implement voucher generation logic in the generate_voucher() method
Task 3: Update the validation logic in the validate_responses() method to validate survey responses
Task 4: Integrate the generate_voucher() method in the main code flow after successful validation
Task 5: Print the voucher details for the customer

Feature 3: User Interface and Error Messaging
Deadline: 3 weeks

Task 1: Implement a user-friendly interface using print statements to display survey questions
Task 2: Handle errors or invalid input during response collection using error handling techniques
Task 3: Display appropriate error messages for incomplete or invalid surveys
Task 4: Validate input to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., numeric input for rating questions)
Task 5: Improve the user experience by providing clear instructions and prompts
